    <h1>WELCOME To PolaksGuideToFreedom!!</h1>
    <h2>THE FOLLOWING PAGES MAY NOT WORK FOR YOU POKEMON SOWDOWN, SFLIX, VUMOO, HDTODAY, YOUTUBE, AND REDDIT. there is a way to fix this and i am working on it so that it can be done not one by one.  AND THE MUSIC BUTTONS ARE GLITCHED THEY WILL NOT WORK JUST USE THIS BUTTON AND I AM FIXING EACH PAGE BY HAND</h2>
    <p>This is kinda basic I will add more things into here when I get better at coding. just to add this in if you think you are a genius and have these websites dont use them, just use this. this is a way to just protect 
      the URL and still be able to use the website.  i added a bunch of new things. over 50 games, 11 rap songs, and 2 random songs including illegals in my yard! and i added apps so people can enjoy free browsing.
